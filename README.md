From Second year Bachelor of Engineering Department of Infomation Technology.
These are possible Object Oriented Programming codes.

Codes may not run you have to make some changes to it like changing class name, changing file name,etc.
As well as codes may be incorrect so try to understand your problem statement properly and then use these codes at your own risk ;-).

Wish you a happy journey.
Danke....
